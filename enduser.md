## What is MasterBrewing?

MasterBrewing allows you to upgrade potions far beyond vanilla Minecraft's limitations! With Master Brewing Stands, you can:

- **Increase potion duration** by brewing with redstone (up to 30 minutes or more)
- **Increase potion power** by brewing with glowstone (up to 6 levels or more)
- **Use special potions** like Fly and Fortune
- **Instant activation** - no waiting for drinking animation!

## Getting Started

### Obtaining a Master Brewing Stand

Master Brewing Stands are purchased using in-game currency via the /shop command. Once you have one:

1. **Place it** like a normal brewing stand
2. **Add fuel** (blaze powder) just like vanilla brewing
3. **Start brewing** - it works just like a normal stand, but better!

### Your First Master Potion

1. Brew a **normal potion** in your Master Brewing Stand (e.g., Speed potion using sugar)
2. Once brewed, you now have a potion ready to upgrade!
3. The Master Brewing Stand preserves your potions when broken, including all contents and fuel

## How to Upgrade Potions

### Upgrading Duration (Time Level)

**Use Redstone Dust** to increase how long your potion lasts:

1. Place your potion in the Master Brewing Stand
2. Add **redstone dust** to the ingredient slot
3. Wait for brewing to complete
4. Your potion now lasts longer!

**Important**: Each upgrade level requires more redstone. Check your potion's lore to see the cost for the next upgrade.

### Upgrading Power (Power Level)

**Use Glowstone Dust** to increase your potion's strength:

1. Place your potion in the Master Brewing Stand
2. Add **glowstone dust** to the ingredient slot
3. Wait for brewing to complete
4. Your potion is now more powerful!

**Important**: Each upgrade level requires more glowstone. Check your potion's lore to see the cost for the next upgrade.

### Upgrade Costs

The amount of materials needed increases with each level:
- **Level 1**: Usually 1 redstone/glowstone
- **Level 2**: Usually 4 redstone/glowstone  
- **Level 3**: Usually 16 redstone/glowstone
- **Higher levels**: Can require up to 64 glowstone/redstone for the upgrade

*Note: Different potion types may have different upgrade costs. Always check the potion's lore!*

## Understanding Potion Levels

### Time Level
- Determines how long the potion effect lasts
- Level 0 = Base duration (usually 3 minutes)
- Higher levels = Longer duration (can reach hours!)
- Shown in yellow text on the potion lore

### Power Level
- Determines the strength of the effect
- Level 0 = Roman numeral I
- Level 1 = Roman numeral II
- Higher levels = Stronger effect
- Shown in green text on the potion lore

### Reading Potion Lore

Master Potions display detailed information:

```
Speed V
Master Potion
Speed: +5 (Max: +7)
Duration: 12m (Max: 30m)
Speed Upgrade: 16 glowstone dust
Duration Upgrade: 16 redstone dust
```

This tells you:
- **Current level**: Speed V (power level 4)
- **Current stats**: +5 speed, 12 minute duration
- **Maximum possible**: +7 speed, 30 minute duration
- **Next upgrade costs**: 16 glowstone for power, 16 redstone for duration

## Using Master Potions

### Instant Activation

Master Potions activate instantly - no drinking animation!

1. **Right-click** with the potion in your hand
2. **Effect activates immediately**
3. **Empty bottle** is returned to your inventory

### Effect Duration

Master Potion effects are tracked and persist even if:
- You log out and back in
- The server restarts
- Other plugins try to remove them

You'll receive warnings when effects are about to expire:
- **30 seconds remaining** - First warning
- **10 seconds remaining** - Final warning

### Multiple Effects

You can have multiple different Master Potion effects active at once!
- Each effect has its own timer
- Effects refresh themselves automatically
- Drinking the same potion type again refreshes that effect's duration

## Special Potion Types

### Fly Potion

Fly potions grant **creative-style flight** in survival mode! 

## How to obtain a Fly Potion

Fly potions can be obtained in several ways:

1. **Chests** - opening a chest can sometimes drop special loot including a Fly potion.  the higher your luck, the more likely it is and the more you get.
2. **Fishing** - fishing can give you special loot including a Fly potion.  the higher your luck and Luck of the Sea, the more you likely it is and the more you get
3. **Redeeming Keys** - Rewards keys are aquired via placing in a jobs event, monster combat, and your harvest hoe.  

> **Note:** You cannot craft this potion. 

**How it works:**
- Enables flight like creative mode
- Higher power levels = faster flight speed
- Base speed: 100% (normal creative speed)
- Max speed: Can reach 300%+ depending on configuration

**Using Flight:**
- Double-tap space to start flying
- Space to go up, Shift to go down
- Flight action bar shows remaining time and level

**Important**: Flight automatically disables when the potion expires. Make sure you're on the ground!

### Fortune Potion

Fortune potions grant the **Luck effect** for better loot!

## How to obtain a Fortune Potion

Fortune potions can be obtained in several ways:

1. **Chests** - opening a chest can sometimes drop special loot including a Fortune potion.  the higher your luck, the more likely it is and the more you get.
2. **Fishing** - fishing can give you special loot including a Fortune potion.  the higher your luck and Luck of the Sea, the more likely it is and the more you get
3. **Redeeming Keys** - Rewards keys are aquired via placing in a jobs event, monster combat, and your harvest hoe.  

> **Note:** You cannot craft this potion. 

**How it works:**
- Increases luck stat for better drops
- Affects fishing, mob drops, and chest loot
- Higher power levels = more luck
- Can reach extreme luck values (65+)

**Best used for:**
- Fishing rare items
- Farming mob drops
- Opening loot chests
- Enchanting (better enchantments)

## Tips and Tricks

### Efficient Upgrading

1. **Upgrade multiple potions at once** - Put 3 potions in the brewing stand
2. **All potions upgrade together** using the same cost
3. **Save materials** by brewing in batches

### Strategic Upgrades

- **Balance duration and power** based on your needs
- Long duration + low power = cheap but effective
- Short duration + high power = expensive but powerful
- Max both = ultimate power, massive cost!

### Potion Management

- **Check lore** before upgrading to see costs
- **Plan ahead** - gather materials for multiple upgrades
- **Store carefully** - Master Potions are valuable!
- **Use at the right time** - Don't waste expensive high-level potions

### Breaking Master Brewing Stands

- **Contents are preserved** - all potions and fuel saved
- **Pick up safely** - break with any tool
- **Relocate freely** - place elsewhere with everything intact
