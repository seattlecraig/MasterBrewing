=====================================

- Make potions last for hours!
=====================================
PAGE 3
=====================================
GETTING STARTED:

First, obtain a Master Brewing Stand from a server admin.

Place it like a normal brewing stand.

Add blaze powder as fuel.

The stand works just like vanilla brewing, but better!
=====================================
PAGE 4
=====================================
BREWING YOUR FIRST POTION:

1. Brew a normal vanilla potion (like Speed using sugar)

2. This creates a potion ready to upgrade

3. The Master Brewing Stand preserves potions when broken
=====================================
PAGE 5
=====================================
UPGRADING DURATION:

Use REDSTONE DUST to make potions last longer.

1. Place your potion in the stand
2. Add redstone to ingredient slot
3. Wait for brewing
4. Your potion now lasts longer!

Check the potion lore to see upgrade costs.
=====================================
PAGE 6
=====================================
UPGRADING POWER:

Use GLOWSTONE DUST to make potions stronger.

1. Place your potion in the stand
2. Add glowstone to ingredient slot
3. Wait for brewing
4. Your potion is now more powerful!

Each level requires more materials.
=====================================
PAGE 7
=====================================
UPGRADE COSTS:

Level 1: Usually 1 material
Level 2: Usually 4 materials
Level 3: Usually 16 materials
Level 4: Usually 32 materials
Level 5: Usually 64 materials

Different potions may have different costs!
=====================================

=====================================
PAGE 10
=====================================
USING MASTER POTIONS:

Master Potions work differently than vanilla:

- RIGHT-CLICK to use
- Effect activates INSTANTLY
- No drinking animation
- Empty bottle returned
=====================================
PAGE 11
=====================================
EFFECT DURATION:

Master Potion effects persist even if you:
- Log out and back in
- Server restarts
- Other things happen

Warnings appear at:
- 30 seconds remaining
- 10 seconds remaining
=====================================
PAGE 12
=====================================
MULTIPLE EFFECTS:

You CAN have multiple different potion effects active!

Each effect has its own timer.

Drinking the same type again refreshes that effect.
=====================================
PAGE 13
=====================================
FLIGHT POTIONS:

Flight potions grant creative-style flight in survival!

- Double-tap space to fly
- Space to go up
- Shift to go down
- Higher levels = faster flight

WARNING: Land before it expires!
=====================================
PAGE 14
=====================================
FLIGHT SPEED:

Power Level I: 100% speed (normal creative)
Power Level II: 120% speed
Power Level III: 140% speed
Power Level IV: 160% speed
Power Level V: 180% speed

Even higher levels possible!
=====================================
PAGE 15
=====================================
FORTUNE POTIONS:

Fortune potions grant the Luck effect for better loot!

Effects:
- Better fishing catches
- Better mob drops
- Better chest loot
- Better enchantments

Can reach extreme luck values!
=====================================
PAGE 16
=====================================
EFFICIENT UPGRADING:

TIP: Upgrade multiple potions at once!

Put 3 potions in the brewing stand.

All potions upgrade together using the SAME cost.

This saves materials!
=====================================
PAGE 17
=====================================
STRATEGIC UPGRADES:

Balance duration and power:

- Long duration + low power = cheap but effective
- Short duration + high power = expensive but powerful
- Max both = ultimate power!
=====================================
PAGE 18
=====================================
POTION MANAGEMENT:

- Always check lore before upgrading
- Plan ahead for materials
- Store master potions carefully
- Use at the right time
- Don't waste expensive potions!
=====================================
PAGE 19
=====================================
BREAKING BREWING STANDS:

When you break a Master Brewing Stand:

- All contents are saved
- All fuel is saved
- Break with any tool
- Place elsewhere safely
