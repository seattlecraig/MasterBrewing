# MasterBrewing Configuration
# 
# upgrade-time: Controls duration upgrades using redstone
# Format: level,redstone-cost,duration-seconds
# - level: The upgrade tier (1, 2, 3, etc.)
# - redstone-cost: Number of redstone required (max 64)
# - duration-seconds: Potion duration in seconds
# The highest level number becomes the maximum time level
#
# upgrade-power: Controls power/amplifier upgrades using glowstone
# Format: level,glowstone-cost
# - level: The upgrade tier (1, 2, 3, etc.)
# - glowstone-cost: Number of glowstone dust required (max 64)
# The highest level number becomes the maximum power level
#
# Per-Potion Overrides:
# You can override the default upgrade paths for specific potions by adding sections
# named after the potion type (e.g., "fortune:", "speed:", "strength:").
# Each potion section can have its own upgrade-time and/or upgrade-power lists.
# If only one is specified, the default is used for the other.
#
# Available potion types for overrides:
# fortune, fly, speed, slowness, haste, mining_fatigue, strength, healing, harming,
# leaping, nausea, regeneration, resistance, fire_resistance, water_breathing,
# invisibility, blindness, night_vision, hunger, weakness, poison, wither,
# health_boost, absorption, saturation, glowing, levitation, luck, unluck,
# slow_falling, conduit_power, dolphins_grace, bad_omen, hero_of_the_village, darkness
#
# Example: A Speed I potion brewed with 1 glowstone becomes Speed II (power level 1)
#          Then brewed with 1 redstone becomes Speed II with 360s duration (time level 1)
#          Then brewed with 4 glowstone becomes Speed III with 360s duration (power level 2)
#          Then brewed with 4 redstone becomes Speed III with 720s duration (time level 2)
