Welcome to Master Brewing!

Master Brewing lets you create potions far more powerful than vanilla Minecraft allows.

Longer durations. Stronger effects. Custom powers like Flight.

This book will teach you everything you need to know.
=====================================

=====================================
What You Need

To brew Master Potions you need:

- A Master Brewing Stand
- Blaze Powder (fuel)
- A vanilla potion with an effect
- Redstone Dust (for duration)
- Glowstone Dust (for power)
=====================================
PAGE 3
=====================================
Getting Started

Place a vanilla potion in one of the three bottle slots.

The potion must already have an effect like Speed, Strength, or Regeneration.

Water bottles won't work.
=====================================
PAGE 4
=====================================
Adding Fuel

Put Blaze Powder in the fuel slot (bottom left).

One Blaze Powder gives 20 fuel charges.

Each upgrade uses one charge.
=====================================
PAGE 5
=====================================
Duration Upgrades

Add Redstone Dust to the ingredient slot.

This increases how long the potion lasts.

Higher levels need more Redstone.

Check the potion's lore to see costs.
=====================================
PAGE 6
=====================================
Power Upgrades

Add Glowstone Dust to the ingredient slot.

This increases the effect strength.

Speed I becomes Speed II, then III, IV, and beyond!

Check the potion's lore for costs.
=====================================

=====================================
Instant Brewing

Unlike vanilla brewing, Master Brewing upgrades happen instantly.

As soon as you have the right materials, the upgrade is applied.

Fly Potions

Fly potions grant survival flight.

Be careful when it expires!

Fortune potions give enhanced luck.

Better drops from mobs and chests.
